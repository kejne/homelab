# Home lab ðŸ¥¼
A GitOps setup for my Kubernetes home lab!

## Purpose

Using old computers available at home to create a cluster on low level to get an understanding of the fundamental parts in a Kubernetes cluster as well as using the cluster for experimenting with deployments, persistence, network and other aspects best done in an environment like a home lab.

This repository acts as the go-to location for defining the state of the home lab, using GitOps to keep the cluster up to date.

## Setup

For starters, the homelab will not have a too complicated Argo CD setup. Just trying to keep it to a single app if possible and focusing on other topics.
